Name: Kelton Hislop

Instructions and Notes:
Unfortunatly I only was able to finish part 1. The program will non-recursivly ask the name server specified. If it does not have an answer it should simply return a mesage saying so. 

Program will run with format stated in the handout.
ex.
./project2 iaddress nameserver
./project2 www.mines.edu 138.67.1.2

Currently options have to go at the end of the file (currently only -d)
ex.
./project2 www.mines.edu 138.67.1.2 -d
